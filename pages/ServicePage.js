                <h1>SuperRare Terms of Service</h1>
                <h5>Last Updated: Nov. 22, 2021</h5>
                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <h4>Welcome to SuperRare!  SuperRare is a decentralized application and digital art marketplace operating on the Ethereum blockchain.  The SuperRare Platform uses specially-developed smart contracts that enable Artists to sell their digital creations to Collectors on a peer-to-peer digital marketplace.  Collectors may trade, transfer, sell, or proudly display their collected SuperRare pieces on the SuperRare Platform.</h4>
                <h3>These Terms Set Forth a Legally Binding Agreement</h3>
                <h4>Please read these Terms of Use (“Terms”, “Terms of Use”, or “Agreement”) very carefully. This Agreement is between you (the “User(s),” “Artist(s),” “Collector(s),” “Owner(s),” and collectively with others using the Site - “Users”) and SuperRare Labs Inc., a company operating the SuperRare platform and organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (“SuperRare Labs Inc.,” “the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us” and together with you, the “Parties”).  These Terms govern your use of the website located at SuperRare.co and SuperRare.com (the “Site”), and all related tools, mobile applications, web applications, decentralized applications, smart contracts, and APIs located at any of SuperRare Labs' websites, including without limitation, successor website(s) or application(s) thereto (the “Platform”).</h4>
                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                <h4>Our Privacy Policy found <a href='PrivacyPage'>here</a> describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information, and is hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms. You agree to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</h4>

                <h2>The Platform</h2>
                <h3>Accessing the Platform through MetaMask</h3>
                <h4>To most easily access and use the Platform, you should first install the Google Chrome or Brave web browser.  Once you have installed Chrome or Brave, you will need to install a browser extension called MetaMask.  MetaMask is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase (either directly via Coinbase if you are in the United States, or via other third-party sites), store, and engage in transactions using the native Ethereum cryptocurrency, ETH. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the Platform other than through MetaMask (or other Ethereum-compatible browsers). The Platform will only recognize you as a User, and you will only be able to interact with the Platform if your Ethereum electronic wallet is connected and unlocked through your MetaMask account. There is no other way to sign up as a User or to interact directly with the Platform.</h4>

                <h3>Transactions Are Recorded on the Public Ethereum Blockchain</h3>
                <h4>Transactions that take place on the Platform are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. The User understands that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the Platform.  We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third-party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the Platform. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.</h4>

                <h4>SuperRare Labs reserves the right to terminate, suspend or restrict your access to any Account(s) if there is reasonable suspicion by us that the person logged into your Account(s) is not you or if we suspect that the Account(s) have been or will be used for any illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorized purposes.

                <h3>User Must Be of Age</h3>

IF YOU ARE 13 OR OLDER BUT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE YOU RESIDE IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, THEN YOU AGREE TO REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH YOU AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS.  YOU AGREE TO HAVE YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN REVIEW AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON YOUR BEHALF. IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AGREEING TO THE TERMS FOR THE BENEFIT OF A CHILD OVER 13, THEN YOU AGREE TO AND ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT CHILD’S USE OF THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING ALL FINANCIAL CHARGES AND LEGAL LIABILITY THAT HE OR SHE MAY INCUR.</h4>

                <h2>SuperRare Items</h2>
                <h4>All Artwork (“Art”, “Work(s)”, “Artwork(s)”, or “Creation(s)”) on the SuperRare Platform is represented by a unique cryptographic token exclusively Minted by one of SuperRare’s approved Artists.  Each SuperRare Item (“Item(s)”, “Token(s)”, “Non-fungible token(s)”, or “NFT(s)”) is Minted by an Artist using the SuperRare Smart Contracts based on an Artist’s original Artwork.  SuperRare Items are forever tracked and stored on the Ethereum blockchain, providing the Collector of a SuperRare Item with a permanent record of authenticity and ownership.</h4>

                <h3>Creating SuperRare Items</h3>
                <h4>Only Artists invited and approved by SuperRare are able to use the Platform to “Mint” and sell SuperRare Items.  Artwork Minted and sold on the SuperRare Marketplace includes, but is not limited to: visual works, audiovisual works, animations, audio, photographs, 3D works, GIFS, and other creative digital works.</h4>
            
                <h3>Applying to be a SuperRare Artist</h3>
                <h4>Artists seeking an invitation to create and list works for sale on the SuperRare Platform must submit a Request found <a href=''>here</a>.  SuperRare has unilateral discretion in curating its Artist Network and makes no guarantees or promises that any Artists will be approved, even if the Artist was invited by a member of the SuperRare Team to submit the Request.</h4>

                <h3>Artist Whitelisting and Minting</h3>
                <h4>Approved Artists are “Whitelisted” and granted permission to Mint SuperRare Items using one or more of our Smart Contracts.  To create a SuperRare Item, Approved Artists must upload an original digital Artwork, provide information about the artwork, authenticate the work, initiate a request to a token Minting Smart Contract, and – voila – the Artist has Minted a unique, cryptographic token representing a digital version of the artwork.</h4>

                <h3>Artist Agrees to Mint only “Original” Works</h3>
                <h4>By Minting a SuperRare Item, Artists expressly represent and warrant that their Work is an original creation.  Artists are prohibited from Minting Works consisting of unlicensed or unauthorized copyrighted content, including any imagery, design, audio, video, human likeness, or other unoriginal content not created by the Artist, not authorized for use by the Artist, not in the public domain, or otherwise without a valid claim of fair use.  Artist can only mint works that they personally created and must refrain from minting works to which copyright ownership is unknown or disputed (i.e., commissioned works or “works made for hire”).</h4>

                <h3>SuperRare Copyright Community Guidelines</h3>
                <h4>Copyright is the law of art.  As a digital art platform, we take copyright law seriously and encourage our Artists and Collectors to learn more about their rights.  Please visit the SuperRare Copyright Community Guidelines for more information on copyright law, the difference between “original” and “infringing” content, and the fair use defense.</h4>

                <h3>Artists Must Have Authority to Mint, Display, and Sell the Work</h3>
                <h4>Artist expressly represents and warrants that works Minted on the SuperRare Platform contain only original artistic content otherwise authorized for use by the Artist.  To the extent a Work contains unoriginal content, including content from Works by other SuperRare Artists, the Minting Artist further represents and warrants that it has permission to incorporate the unoriginal content.  Artist represents and warrants that the sale, display or performance of minted SuperRare Item on the Platform is not a violation of any agreement, contract, or obligation owed to a third party.</h4>

                <h3>Artists May Be Removed from the Platform</h3>
                <h4>Failure to abide by these Terms and/or the Community Guidelines may result in, without limitation, suspension or deletion of the Artist’s account, revocation of the Artist’s minting privileges and other permissions to the SuperRare Smart Contracts or Platform, delisting the Artist’s items on the Site, or paying monetary damages.  SuperRare has the unilateral authority and discretion to remove, suspend, or revoke Artists’ access to the SuperRare Smart Contracts or any other aspect of the Platform.</h4>

                <h3>Artist Indemnifies and Releases SuperRare Labs</h3>
                <h4>Artist hereby agrees to indemnify SuperRare Labs and be held liable for any claim against SuperRare Labs arising out of the Artist’s breach of these Terms.  Artist hereby releases and forever discharges SuperRare Labs from any damages or causes of action resulting from a sale of any of the Artist’s listed SuperRare Items occurring after the Artist’s breach of these Terms.</h4>

                <h2>The SuperRare Labs Marketplace</h2>
                <h4>The SuperRare Platform facilitates a peer-to-peer digital art Marketplace and auction house where Artists, Collectors, and other Users can sell, purchase, list for auction, make offers, and bid on SuperRare Items.  Collectors can obtain SuperRare Items by making an offer accepted by the Artist, purchasing at an established List Price, or bidding on Items available in one of our revolutionary smart contract-enabled auctions.</h4>

                <h3>Purchasing SuperRare Items with a List Price</h3>
                <h4>SuperRare Items are optionally offered for immediate acceptance at a List Price (in ETH) established by the Artist.  Collectors can purchase SuperRare Items with a List Price through the Site by sending an equivalent amount of ETH to a Smart Contract configured to initiate a transfer of the SuperRare Item, plus additional fees and gas.</h4>

                <h3>Making Offers on SuperRare Items</h3>
                <h4>Users can make offers on all listed SuperRare Items through the Site.  Offers on the SuperRare Labs Marketplace are legally binding, revocable offers to purchase the Item capable of immediate acceptance by the Owner of the Item.  By making an offer, the Collector agrees to temporarily send and lose control over an amount of offered ETH to a Smart Contract.  The Smart Contract is configured to hold the offered ETH until either the offer is accepted by the Owner of the Item, a higher offer is received, or the offer is revoked.  The Owner of the Item has the unilateral authority to accept the bid.</h4>
